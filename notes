pseudo rule that checks if all walls + trs placed and resolves empties to hallway to skip complicated rules running when the grid is essentially solved (or just have all TRs complete be first)
cutseying names:
  is WallBoundBoxinternalStructure actually just a TBeam?
  should beams get redefined/split up?  I beam => only the two relevant rows, E beam => two main rows plus each cross row, monsterous * beam => monster in a block?
  hall crawls could use better names
add monster handling to 2 wall scenario for WBBs?
add WBB handling 2x2s that contain known walls/empties?
dedupe selections in bifurcation
dedupe C&P logic in wall trap + double wall trap
improve description fields in ApplyResult
  - explain why
  - hints for the forcers?
should treasure room cannot expand get broken up and applied in multiple rules?
single-pass up-front rules?
Make CantReachTreasure bulk operate?
  - counterpoint:  this rule is unhumanlike and so should be avoided in an ideal solve anyway
board validation on initial create?
is there a way to avoid having to rerun rules if nothing that could affect them changed?
isvalid test should define w/ char input rather than code
cleanup pass
  - find homes for static methods in Board (possibly grid)
    - createBoard as companion object
    - validation
  - ApplyResult subtypes?  (contradiction vs not applicable vs real?)
rework the way real dnd tests are run to not require as much C&P and get aggregate metrics


enable rule selection/ordering
